OpenMRac is a split-screen racing game. It is a tweaked source release of [MultiRacer](https://www.franticware.com/multiracer).

Programming was done by Vojtƒõch Salajka.  
Porting to big endian architectures for Amiga-like OSes was done by [Szil√°rd Bir√≥](https://github.com/BSzili).

‚ö†Ô∏è Beware! The source code is old and messy, plus most comments are in Czech üòÅ

Creating forks and porting to additional platforms is encouraged, but these typically will not be merged back to the main repo. The same applies to mods.

Franticware claims rights to the name "MultiRacer" which should not be used by other parties for their products or ports. That is the reason for changing the title to OpenMRac, to which no such restrictions apply.

Game data files are in a separate repository under a different license: https://github.com/Franticware/OpenMRac-data

# Installation Instructions

## Windows

Download here: https://www.franticware.com/openmrac

## Linux

### Arch-based (Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, ...)

Install **openmrac** package from AUR

### Debian-based (Debian, Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, MX Linux, Mint, ...)

* Install **sox**
* Install development packages for OpenGL, OpenAL, SDL 2, jpeg, png
* Run the following to generate **openmrac.deb** package:

```
mkdir openmrac-deb
cd openmrac-deb
git clone https://github.com/Franticware/OpenMRac.git
git clone https://github.com/Franticware/OpenMRac-data.git
cd OpenMRac/src
make -f Makefile.linux deb
cd ../../..
```

* Install the package:

```
sudo dpkg -i openmrac-deb/OpenMRac/src/debian/openmrac.deb
```

Notes:

* For simplicity, the resulting package contains both binary and data files. Packagers for Linux distributions will probably want to create a separate package for game data. See existing [AUR packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&K=openmrac) for inspiration.

* RFP for Debian can be found here: https://wiki.debian.org/Games/Suggested#OpenMRac
